ABOUT THIS PROJECT

In my search for a pure Java library for creating appealing TUIs (text-based
user interface), I came up short of anything that resembled a suitable 
solution. Available libraries either attempt to wrap native ncurses code or are
inadequate for the types of projects that I wish to build. This library 
therefore aims to fill that need for a reliable, modern, and pure-Java library
for creating appealing terminal user interfaces.

In order to avoid using formatting characters to create the UI (as ncurses 
does), I have opted to wrap everything in a terminal emulator written on
top of Swing. This also has the convenient trade-off of making the buffer
dynamic; we don't have to clear the terminal before redrawing a region of
the interface. I also hope to make font-rendering consistent across all
platforms on which an application is run, in a truly portable fashion.

On operating systems like Windows, the terminal does not allow for per-
character color information, nor does it allow for an easy way to control low-
level formatting of the text. This API should provide a consistent interface
across all Java-compatible machines, and present an application in the same
fashion to all of its clients.
